"""Regression: do not probe absent vendor-specific CPU sysfs with Quickshell.

The owner runs a system where the Intel pstate status file does not exist.
Quickshell FileView.path='' explicitly unloads a file rather than reading it;
refresh must also skip probes with an empty path. Hardware acceptance remains
separate: this test does not assume that any CPU driver is present.
