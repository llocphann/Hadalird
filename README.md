# Hadalird

Optional small and medium application integrations for Hadalis: TLP, Thinkfan
and Obsidian. Hadalis owns generic Battery, Power Profiles, Todo, Notes,
configuration and UI primitives. Hadalird owns the integration workers,
application-specific settings, byte-safe vault helpers and privileged helper
payloads. Existing integration preferences and application data are retained.

Install a committed revision with `make install`. Installation does not enable
an integration, launch Obsidian, change fan/charge policies, or stop existing
system services. Each integration loads one disposable QML tree when explicitly
enabled in Hadalis. Missing packages report unavailable rather than claiming an
operation succeeded. `make uninstall` deactivates only this package's owned
link; releases, user configuration, vaults and system services are preserved.

Privileged helper installation is separate: `sudo make install-helpers`.
This installs helper/polkit/schema files and does not enable services or create
TLP configuration overrides. Prefixes and `DESTDIR` are supported for packaging.
`LIBEXECDIR`, `POLKIT_ACTIONS_DIR`, `INIR_SYSTEM_SHAREDIR` and `TLP_CONFDIR`
control helper, policy, schema and profile locations; helper installation does
not create profile directories or overrides. TLP (including its optional
Radio Device Wizard), Thinkfan and Obsidian remain separately installed apps.

Run `make test` for scoped filesystem/helper and installation contracts.
Native tests use the sibling `Hadalis` checkout by default; set
`HADALIS_ROOT=/path/to/Hadalis` for another location. They require Quickshell,
Qt 6 and private Niri, and use synthetic vaults and injected status helpers.
Initial provenance is recorded in `manifest.json`. All current
implementation, host-cutover, native integration and new feature **tasks are
managed centrally in [Alis dev](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis/blob/dev/to-do/README.md)**,
using its [Issues](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis/blob/dev/to-do/cloud-bot/ISSUES.md),
[Rework](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis/blob/dev/to-do/cloud-bot/REWORK_OPTIMIZATION.md)
and [New features](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis/blob/dev/to-do/cloud-bot/NEW_FEATURES.md)
lists. This repository continues to own optional TLP, Thinkfan and Obsidian
source, QML Settings, helpers and tests, but has no separate active task
queue. Every change should reference its selected Alis task and pin the
compatible Alis host and Integration source SHAs, with actual test receipts
and remaining real-device/user-permission gates. No user data, vault or
privileged system settings are modified merely by centralizing TODOs.

Classic and Waffle TLP editors and Obsidian task/capture settings are owned
here. Hadalis retains navigation, optional loaders, generic Battery controls
and the preserved internal Todo store. The version 0.2 settings entrypoints
are additive for host API 1; update Hadalird before the corresponding host
cutover. Integration enable switches remain off by default.
